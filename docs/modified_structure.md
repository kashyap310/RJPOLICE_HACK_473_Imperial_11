Here's a modified structure:

|   |-- app.py           # Flask web application
|   |-- templates/       # HTML templates for the web app

|-- gateways/
|   |-- tor/

|   |   |-- tor_utils.py          # Shared utility functions for Tor

|   |
|   |-- i2p/
|   |   |-- i2p_gateway.py        # Python script for I2P gateway

|       |-- freenet_crawler.py    # Python crawler specific to Freenet
|
|-- shared/
|   |-- common_utils.py           # Shared utility functions not specific to gateways
|

Explanation:

- *gateways:* Each gateway directory now includes a specific Python crawler (*_crawler.py) for that gateway. These crawlers are tailored to interact with the corresponding gateway.
- *shared:* Still contains utility functions that are not specific to any particular gateway, including common utilities that can be used by multiple crawlers or gateways.
- *main.py:* Can now coordinate the gateways and their respective crawlers. Depending on your design, you might start the crawlers alongside the gateways.

This structure enables you to manage different crawlers for different gateways and keep the codebase modular. Adapt the structure based on the specific needs of your crawlers and how they interact with their corresponding gateways.
