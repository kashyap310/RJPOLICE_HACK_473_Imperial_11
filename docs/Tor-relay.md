## Tor relay
Tor relays, also known as nodes or routers, receive and pass along traffic on the Tor network. Tor is a free, open-source software that enables anonymous communication. It directs internet traffic through a network of over seven thousand relays.

### Relay monitoring methods: 
* [Nyx](https://nyx.torproject.org/#home): A command-line monitor that provides real-time information about your relay. This includes bandwidth usage, connections, and logs.
* [The Onion Box](https://pypi.org/project/theonionbox/): A web interface that monitors the operation of a Tor node.
* Arm: A terminal status monitor for Tor relays.
